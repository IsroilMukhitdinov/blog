["Indeed, he was happy among his family"]("https://quran.com/84/13")

<cite>Quran 84:13</cite>


When Kafka said "I have spent all my life resisting the urge to end it", I immediately said "That is me".

A quick back story:
    When I was about 14 or 15, I was quite recognized in any setting I would be in.
    People used to praise me for my intellectual superiority. I was physically fit and my belief in God was
    so strong that I used to think "I got it". I literally knew no one on this green earth of God as well-balanced as me
    in any non-trivial area of life. But things change.

["You will certainly pass from one stage to another"]("https://quran.com/84/19")

<cite>Quran 84:19</cite>

Life is about successfull utilization of time and space.
Prophet Joseph (pbuh) was thrown into the well, he (pbuh) was in the house of that lady who wanted to seduce him (pbuh) to do the unlawfull, he (pbuh) was imprisoned, he (pbuh) was given a high position. But none of them was chosen by him (pbuh). In fact, after all these Joseph (pbuh) asked his Lord

["Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous."]("https://quran.com/12/101")

Life is constantly moving from one stage (stage is defined by time & space) to another. And it is out of our control whether we like it or not.


I have been living on my own for the last 6 years now and my life was totally out of balance lately
and it had gone to a place where it was no longer manageable. I could not make sense of the world. I was mad at it and its people.
I have been suicidal all the time, although I knew I would never do that to myself. Nevertheles, thoughts would come but somehow
something kept me on earth. I do not think these feelings changed really, but I am just acquented with the reality of them now.
Still things do not make sense, but only Allah does. Still I do not like the world and the things many of its people do, but some beautiful human beings restored my faith in how pure a human being can possibly be. Still I think about ending my life, but knowing it would be despicable in the Eyes of Allah keeps me on this planet. Besides, even if the whole world can take it, my mom cannot. And I do not want her to be in pain. But the point I am trying to drive home here is not about how my life was in the past and how it is now. In fact, I love to keep that super private to myself. The point I want to convey is that I did not know the truth and my perception of reality was outdated (I would perceive the world like a child) and even distorted. Therefore I failed miserably. I lost my life. And I can see this pattern in the lives of many people that they do not even care about the truth. But I know you do, because you would not even come this far reading my article. I appreciate that part of you that yearns for truth. People have not even entertain a single thought about what is truth and what is falsehood. But unfortunately (maybe fortunately as you will realize) sooner or later, all those people will go broken. I am not in any way cursing them. But that is the pre-determined consequence of neglecting the truth. I know very well about the pain of being a loser. Trust me, if anyone wants to face that pain, they would rather want to disappear out of existence. But on this planet, we are forced and that is a good thing. You cannot choose anything except the color of your toothbrush. I can see everyone is hoping to escape that stage trying to delay the pain it brings. But, man, time and space is given by Allah to every single person. We do not choose the stage we want to be in. Prophets did not choose their time and space. The sun and moon do not choose their stage.

["So, I do swear by the twilight!"]("https://quran.com/84/16")

["And by the night and whatever it envelops!"]("https://quran.com/84/17")

["And by the moon when it waxes full!"]("https://quran.com/84/18")

When the moon becomes full, it does not stay full. When the night comes, it does not stay. Everything moves from one stage to another. How you behave in every stage shapes your individuality. The stage you are in does not define you. If you are rich, your wealth does not define you. If you are poor, your poverty does not define you. When Joseph (pbuh) was thrown into the well, he (pbuh)
did not define himself with that stage. When Joseph (pbuh) was the head of the treasures of Egypt, he did not define himself with that stage. But how do we know that ? Because after all that hardships and success, he asked his Lord to cause him die as a muslim.
For him, suffering and enjoyment are the same things.

This brings me to another point:

There is a law of gravity made by Allah which cannot be denied or go against. Similar law exists inside ourselves whether we are
aware of it or not. The law is that human being follows his greater desire. We naturally gravitate towards a lesser pain and there is
nothing wrong about this. In fact, I would argue that it is healthy. Just like, when you throw an abject into the air, it would naturally gravitate towards the earth, when presented with two choices you naturally gravitate toward the one which brings lesser discomfort. That is the reason why those people who do drugs or even in fact living the debaucherous life of any kind cannot get out of their addiction. Because the drugs temporarily provide a lesser pain than facing the realities of the world and ourselves with soberity. But we neglect that it is the long run that matters. 

["But no, you love the immediate."]("https://quran.com/75/20")

<cite>Quran 75:20</cite>

And I believe as long as you breathe an oxygen, you are attached to something in your life. Of course I am generalizing here. But I do not think you would be reading my article if you were free from any attachment. At least, I can tell for a fact that nobody, absolutely nobody is immune to the tricks of the devil. Prophets were not attached to no inch of the world, for example. But it does not mean they were immune to an attachment. Their life was a constant struggle against any sort of attachment from this worldy life. Our attachments are just more subtle than the addiction to drugs or lust. Some are attached to approval from the people, but that addiction is disguised under the name of knowledge or religion.

But how do we heal if we naturally lean towards our attachments. Do we chain ourselves never getting out of home or just walk heads down all the time. The answer is a loud no. The answer lies in the change of perception. A person who is addicted to drinking perceives drinkning including its consequences a lesser pain compared to going out in the real world and struggling towards his ambitions and goals. And he naturally gravitates to drinking.
