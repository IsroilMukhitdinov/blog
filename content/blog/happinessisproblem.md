["Indeed, he was happy among his family"]("https://quran.com/84/13")

<cite>Quran 84:13</cite>


When Kafka said "I have spent all my life resisting the urge to end it", I immediately said "That is me".

A quick back story:
    When I was about 14 or 15, I was quite recognized in any setting I would be in.
    People used to praise me for my intellectual superiority. I was physically fit and my belief in God was
    so strong that I used to think "I got it". I literally knew no one on this green earth of God as well-balanced as me
    in any non-trivial area of life. But things change.

["You will certainly pass from one stage to another"]("https://quran.com/84/19")

<cite>Quran 84:19</cite>

Life is about successfull utilization of time and space.
Prophet Joseph (pbuh) was thrown into the well, he (pbuh) was in the house of that lady who wanted to seduce him (pbuh) to do the unlawfull, he (pbuh) was imprisoned, he (pbuh) was given a high position. But none of those stages was chosen by him (pbuh).

Life is constantly moving from one stage (stage is defined by time & space) to another. And it is out of our control whether we like it or not.

Lately my life has been totally out of balance and it had gone to a place where it was no longer manageable. I could not make sense of the world. I was mad at it and its people.I have been suicidal all the time, although I knew I would never do that to myself. Nevertheles, thoughts would come but somehow something kept me on earth.

I do not think these feelings changed really, but I am just acquainted with the reality of them now.

Still things do not make sense, but only Allah does. Still I do not like the world and the things many of its people do, but some beautiful human beings restored my faith in how pure a human being can possibly be. Still I think about ending my life, but knowing it would be despicable in the Eyes of Allah keeps me on this planet. Besides, even if the whole world can take it, my mom cannot. And I do not want her to be in pain. Never.

But the point I am trying to drive home here is not about how my life was in the past and how it is now. In fact, I love to keep that super private to myself.

The point I want to convey is that I did not know the truth and my perception of reality was outdated (I would perceive the world like a child) and even distorted. I used to think I am way too intelligent for the devil to mess with me. I used to think my health, youth and freshness would stay the same foreever. But in reality that was just a one stage of my life and I mistakenly identified myself with that stage. Ergo I failed miserably. I lost my life.

Now I can see this pattern in the lives of many people that they do not even care about the truth. But I know you do, because you would not even come this far reading my article. I truly appreciate that part of you. Many people have never entertained a single thought about what is truth and what is falsehood. But unfortunately (maybe fortunately as you will realize) sooner or later, all those people will go broken. I am not in any way cursing them. But that is the pre-determined consequence of neglecting the truth. And you have to be lost in order to be found.

I know very well about the pain of being a loser and being lost & confused. Trust me, if anyone were to face that pain, they would rather want to disappear out of existence. But on this planet, we are forced and that is a good thing. We cannot choose anything except the color of our toothbrush.

It seems everyone who is lost and suffering is hoping to escape that stage but without purification, delaying the pain it brings. But, hey!, when Allah sends you a suffering you should feel the pain. We do not choose the stage we want to be in. Prophets did not choose their time and space. The sun and moon do not choose their stage.

["So, I do swear by the twilight!"]("https://quran.com/84/16")

["And by the night and whatever it envelops!"]("https://quran.com/84/17")

["And by the moon when it waxes full!"]("https://quran.com/84/18")

When the moon becomes full, it does not stay full. When the night comes, it does not stay. Everything moves from one stage to another.

How you behave in every stage shapes your individuality.

The stage you are in does not define you. If you are rich, your wealth does not define you. If you are poor, your poverty does not define you. If you are intelligent, your intelligence does not define you. If you are fit, your fitness does not define you.

When Joseph (pbuh) was thrown into the well, he (pbuh) did not define himself with that stage. When Joseph (pbuh) was the head of the treasures of Egypt, he did not define himself with that stage. Because after all that hardships and success, he asked his Lord to cause him die as a muslim. 

["Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous."]("https://quran.com/12/101")

<cite>Quran 12:101</cite>

There is a law of gravity made by Allah which cannot be denied or go against. Similar law exists inside ourselves whether we are
aware of it or not. The law is that human being follows his greater desire. We naturally gravitate towards a lesser pain and there is
nothing wrong about this. In fact, I would argue that it is healthy.

Just like, when you throw an abject into the air, it would naturally gravitate towards the earth, when presented with two choices you naturally gravitate toward the one which brings lesser discomfort. That is the reason why those people who do drugs or even in fact living the debaucherous life of any kind cannot get out of their addiction. Because the drugs temporarily provide a lesser pain than facing the realities of the world and ourselves with soberity. But we neglect that it is the long run that matters. 

["But no, you love the immediate."]("https://quran.com/75/20")

<cite>Quran 75:20</cite>

We all start off as being innocent and pure human beings. In childhood, there is less conditioning and programming. We glow; We reflect the light of Allah, He put in everyone of us. But somehow, this light gets covered up by the conditioning we are fed with, we start loving the things that harm us, we pick up habits that do not serve us; and we eventually lose our life. This is a "divine mistake" which is not an actual mistake but rather a blessing, a great calling from God for us to build our character which is the only thing we will take with us when we die. This is a perfect way for us to take our innocense, ultimately our life back.

But how do you actually take your life back ? Do you have to walk heads down looking at the tip of your feet all the time if you have a problem of lowering your gaze ? Do you have to delete all your social media platforms if you think you are wasting your irreplaceable and invaluable time on them. Do you have to have yourself chained at home if you have a problem of drinking or smoking when you go out with your friends ?

If you want to see it for yourself, which is good, you can experiment and experience these solutions. But none of them will work.
You will end up surpassing your desires instead of transcending them and eventually those desires will get perverted to other extremes anyway.

Why ? Because deep down you still BELIEVE that those habits are enjoyable, comfortable and tasty. Remember you naturally gravitate towards what is less uncomfortable. That is you reality. That is your perception. That was my perception and I suffered a lot because of it. 

If you have any attachment that you feel you should get rid of but somehow you cannot, understand that you cannot do that with your willpower. It will never work. As good of a blessing from Allah as the willpower is, Allah did not give it the ability of transcending desires.

You have to change your perception around the attachment.

And that can never be done by constantly repeating affirmations or just reciting Quran. It comes with deep understanding of realities Allah has created.

And how can anyone understand anything without effort and hardship ?

Your willpower can take you as far as opening up the Quran. But after that you have to read and understand.
