I have always been ambitious of running a personal blog of mine. That must be hugely because of my love for this gift we call writing. Growing up, I have had an incredible privilege of having so many great teachers and I have been heavily influenced by some spectacular individuals on the Internet. All of them continuously emphasized the role of writing all the time. Among them is one of the greatest minds of Computer Science, Leslie Lamport, the man who revolutionized the field of Computer Science with Mathematics.

Before anything else, my purpose from writing posts is to fully understand the concepts and ideas I am trying to learn myself.

Primarily, I will be writing on the various concepts and ideas of `COMPUTER SCIENCE`. Since, Computer Science is an incredibly broad subject, those concepts and ideas are going to be general rather than specific. I feel like that would even be better, since you can apply them anywhere they are appropriate. But God knows the best; Let's see if I can handle that. When there is a need to go to specifics of a topic, we will definitely go there as well. And when that happens, my choice of programming language will probably be either `GO` or `RUST`.

Besides that, I have also an intention to make a series on the high level concepts taught in the book I love the most, and that is none other than `SICP`.

`COMPUTER NETWORKS` is the subject I have been immmersed into these days. I am really trying to get a good grasp of how the whole system of the Internet works. So expect some good detailed explainations of its concepts.

I have been in love with `MATHEMATICS` since I knew myself as a human being and knew how to add numbers together. Math flows in my blood and I love every bit of intellectual challenges it throws at me. Sometimes, I may use this site to present some mathematical ideas as well.
