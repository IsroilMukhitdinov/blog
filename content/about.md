# Hey! I'm Isroil Mukhitdinov

I am a software engineer who loves to make software applications that are flexible, robust and most importantly modular. 

I love to think of computer science and the process of writing software not as just an intellectual activity of the mind, but as an expression of art. 

I've been studying computer science for the last 4 years.
My passion for computer science sparked first when I read the first few chapters of an amazing book named "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by two legendary MIT professors: Harold Abelson & Gerald Jay Susman.
Hence, I started out with glorius Lisp programming language and fell in love with the Functional Programming Paradigm (I like Object-Oriented Design too).


My favorite programming languages are Go, Rust, Zig and of course, Lisp. I speak a bit of Java, Python, Elm and Haskell as well.

Here you can find me writing posts about various topics of computer science.


If you have anything to suggest or discuss with me, please do not hesitate to reach out to me through one of the links provided on this site. I would love to hear from you.
